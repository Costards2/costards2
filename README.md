# üí´ About Me:
Hi! I'm Pedro Costard, a Digital Games student at UNEB with a passion for technology, storytelling, and creating meaningful interactive experiences.

Most of my work revolves around programming and game development, especially using C#, Unity, and .NET. I also have experience with front-end technologies like JavaScript and CSS, and I enjoy combining technical and creative thinking in everything I build.

I‚Äôve worked as a QA intern at EPRA Games, where I was involved in testing, debugging, and improving development processes through organized documentation and team collaboration. This experience strengthened my attention to detail, communication skills, and ability to work in agile environments.

In addition to game development, I have a solid understanding of software architecture, version control with Git, and collaborative workflows. I'm comfortable working independently or as part of a team, and I‚Äôm always looking to learn, improve, and contribute to meaningful projects.

Whether it‚Äôs building systems, solving problems, or crafting engaging experiences, I‚Äôm driven by curiosity and the desire to turn ideas into something real.
